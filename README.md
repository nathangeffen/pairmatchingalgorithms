# Comparison of pair matching algorithms

This is the source code for a paper published in JASSS by Nathan Geffen and
Stefan Scholz titled *Efficient and effective pair-matching algorithms for
microsimulations*.

To run the tests described in that paper, execute run_tests.sh. The results are
written to table.tex. Some graphs are also produced.
